EcoPoints – A Gamified Carbon-Tracking Wallet
EcoPoints is a mobile-first platform that lets everyday users earn crypto rewards by tracking eco‑friendly actions (biking, recycling, renewable energy use, etc.) on Zircuit. By staking tokens on personal sustainability goals and automatically rewarding verified “green” behaviors, EcoPoints turns climate action into a fun, social game and a real-world incentive program. The app uses Zircuit’s high-throughput ZK rollup and account-abstraction to keep transactions fast, secure, and invisible to non‑crypto users


Problem Statement
Individuals want to help solve climate change, but personal impact can feel abstract and hard to track. Most climate platforms focus on education or donations, not on everyday habits. There is no widely adopted “carbon fitness app” that gamifies sustainable behavior and makes it rewarding. Without clear feedback and incentives, users often lose motivation. EcoPoints addresses this by tokenizing good habits: each verified action (like walking instead of driving, recycling, or conserving energy) earns blockchain-based rewards. This makes personal sustainability engaging and measurable.


Solution Overview
EcoPoints leverages Zircuit’s unique features to create a seamless user experience. Because Zircuit is fully EVM‑compatible with sequencer-level security (SLS) and a hybrid ZK‑Rollup design
